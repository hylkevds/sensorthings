[[sensorthings-serviceinterface]]
== SensorThings Service Interface

An OGC SensorThings API service exposes a service document resources that describe its data model. The service document lists the entity sets that can be CRUD. SensorThings API clients can use the service document to navigate the available entities in a hypermedia-driven fashion.


[[uri-components]]
=== URI Components


The OGC SensorThings API service groups the same types of entities into __entity sets.__Each entity has a unique identifier and one-to-many properties. Also, in the case of an entity holding a relationship with entities in other entity sets, this type of relationship is expressed with navigation properties (__i.e.__, navigationLink and associationLink).


Therefore, in order to perform CRUD actions on the resources, the first step is to address to the target resource(s) through URI. There are three major URI components used here, namely (1) __the service root URI__, (2) the __resource path__, and (3) the __query options__. In addition, the service root URI consists of two parts: (1) the location of the SensorThings service and (2) the version number. The version number follows the format indicated below:


    "v"majorversionnumber + "." + minorversionnumber

          |                 |               |
  service root URI     resource path   query options
----


By attaching the resource path after the service root URI, clients can address to different types of resources such as an entity set, __an entity__, __a property__, or __a navigation property__. Finally, clients can apply query options after the resource path to further process the addressed resources, such as sorting by properties or filtering with criteria.

[[usage-address-collection-entities]]
==== Usage 2: address to a collection of entities

To address to an entity set, users can simply put the entity set name after the service root URI. The service returns a JSON object with a property of value. The value of the property SHALL be a list of the entities in the specified entity set.

**URI Pattern:** SERVICE_ROOT_URI/ENTITY_SET_NAME

**Response:** A list of all entities (with all the properties) in the specified entity set when there is no service-driven pagination imposed. The response is represented as a JSON object containing a name/value pair named value. The value of the value name/value pair is a JSON array where each element is representation of an entity or a representation of an entity reference. An empty collection is represented as an empty JSON array.

The count annotation represents the number of entities in the collection. If present, it comes before the value name/value pair.

When there is service-driven pagination imposed, the nextLink annotation is included in a response that represents a partial result.

[[usage-address-entity]]
==== Usage 3: address to an entity in a collection

Users can address to a specific entity in an entity set by place the unique identifier of the entity between brace symbol “()” and put after the entity set name. The service then returns the entity with all its properties.

**URI Pattern:** SERVICE_ROOT_URI/ENTITY_SET_NAME(ID_OF_THE_ENTITY)

**Response:** A JSON object of the entity (with all its properties) that holds the specified id in the entity set.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example request that addresses to an entity in a collection**

**Example Request:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Things(1)


[[usage-address-property-of-entity]]
==== Usage 4: address to a property of an entity

Users can address to a property of an entity by specifying the property name after the URI addressing to the entity. The service then returns the value of the specified property. If the property has a complex type value, properties of that value can be addressed by further property name composition.

If the property is single-valued and has the null value, the service SHALL respond with 204 No Content. If the property is not available, for example due to permissions, the service SHALL respond with 404 Not Found.

 [Adapted from OData 4.0-Protocol 11.2.3]


**URI Pattern:** SERVICE_ROOT_URI/RESOURCE_PATH_TO_AN_ENTITY/PROPERTY_NAME

**Response:** The specified property of an entity that holds the id in the entity set.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example to address to a property of an entity**

**Example Request:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Observations(1)/resultTime

.Example Response:

  "resultTime": "2010-12-23T10:20:00-07:00"
}
----


[[usage-address-value-of-property]]
==== Usage 5: address to the value of an entity’s property

To address the raw value of a primitive property, clients append a path segment containing the string `+$value+` to the property URL.

The default format for TM_Object types is text/plain using the ISO8601 format, such as `+2014-03-01T13:00:00Z/2015-05-11T15:30:00Z+` for TM_Period and `+2014-03-01T13:00:00Z+` for TM_Instant.

**URI Pattern:** SERVICE_ROOT_URI/ENTITY_SET_NAME(ID_OF_THE_ENTITY)/PROPERTY_NAME/$value

**Response:** The raw value of the specified property of an entity that holds the id in the entity set.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example of addressing to the value of an entity’s property**

**Example:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Observations(1)/resultTime/$value

----


[[usage-address-navigation-property]]
==== Usage 6: address to a navigation property (navigationLink)

As the entities in different entity sets may hold some relationships, users can request the linked entities by addressing to a navigation property of an entity. The service then returns one or many entities that hold a certain relationship with the specified entity.

**URI Pattern:** SERVICE_ROOT_URI/ENTITY_SET_NAME(ID_OF_THE_ENTITY)/LINK_NAME

**Response:** A JSON object of one entity or a JSON array of many entities that holds a certain relationship with the specified entity.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example request addressing to a navigational property**

     http://example.org/v1.0/Datastreams(1)/Observations

 returns all the Observations in the Datastream that holds the id 1.


[[usage-address-associationlink]]
==== Usage 7: address to an associationLink

As the entities in different entity sets may hold some relationships, users can request the linked entities’ selfLinks by addressing to an association link of an entity. An associationLink can be used to retrieve a reference to an entity or an entity set related to the current entity. Only the selfLinks of related entities are returned when resolving associationLinks.

**URI Pattern:** SERVICE_ROOT_URI/ENTITY_SET_NAME(KEY_OF_THE_ENTITY)/LINK_NAME/$ref

**Response:** A JSON object with a value property. The value of the value property is a JSON array containing one element for each associationLink. Each element is a JSON object with a name/value pairs. The name is url and the value is the selfLinks of the related entities.

**Example {counter:examples}: an example of addressing to an association link**

**Example Request:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Datastreams(1)/Observations/$ref

returns all the selfLinks of the Observations of Datastream(1).

    }
  ]
}
----


[[usage-nested-resource-path]]
==== Usage 8: nested resource path

As users can use navigation properties to link from one entity set to another, users can further extend the resource path with unique identifiers, properties, or links (__i.e.__, Usage 3, 4 and 6).

**Example {counter:examples}: examples of nested resource path**

**Example Request 1:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Datastreams(1)/Observations(1)

returns a specific Observation entity in the Datastream.

**Example Request 2:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Datastreams(1)/Observations(1)/resultTime

turns the resultTime property of the specified Observation in the Datastream.

**Example Request 3:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Datastreams(1)/Observations(1)/FeatureOfInterest

returns the FeatureOfInterest entity of the specified Observation in the Datastream.

Clients issue HTTP GET requests to OGC SensorThings API services for data. The resource path of the URL specifies the target of the request. Additional query operators can be specified through query options that are presented as follows. The query operators are prefixed with a dollar ($) character and specified as key-value pairs after the question symbol (?) in the request URI. Many of the OGC SensorThings API’s query options are adapted from OData’s query options. OData developers should be able to pick up SensorThings API query options very quickly.

* $filter
* $count
* $orderby
* $skip
* $top

After applying any server-driven pagination:

* $expand
* $select

Req <<req-request-data-count>>: <<requirement-request-data-count>>

|The $count system query option with a value of true specifies that the total count of items within a collection matching the request SHALL be returned along with the result. A $count query option with a value of false (or not specified) hints that the service SHALL not return a count.

The service SHALL return an HTTP Status code of 400 Bad Request if a value other than true or false is specified.

The $count system query option SHALL ignore any $top, $skip, or $expand query options, and SHALL return the total count of results across all pages including only those results matching any specified $filter. Clients should be aware that the count returned inline may not exactly equal the actual number of items returned, due to latency between calculating the count and enumerating the last value or due to inexact calculations on the service.

|[[requirement-request-data-filter,request-data/filter]]
Req <<req-request-data-filter>>: <<requirement-request-data-filter>>

|The $filter system query option allows clients to filter a collection of entities that are addressed by a request URL. The expression specified with $filter is evaluated for each entity in the collection, and only items where the expression evaluates to true SHALL be included in the response. Entities for which the expression evaluates to false or to null, or which reference properties that are unavailable due to permissions, SHALL be omitted from the response.

 [Adapted from Data 4.0-URL Conventions 5.1.1]

The expression language that is used in $filter operators SHALL support references to properties and literals. The literal values SHALL be strings enclosed in single quotes, numbers and boolean values (true or false) or datetime values represented as ISO 8601 time string.

If one of the two operands of a built-in filter operator is a property of data type Any and the other is a literal or a property not of data type Any nor String,
the service MUST include only the items whose values are of the same JSON data type as the literal/other property and fulfil the query.
If one of the two operands is a literal or property of data type String and the other is a literal or a property not of data type string, the values of all items are
cast to string before the operator is applied and all items that fulfil the query MUST be included in the result.
If both operands of a built-in filter operator are properties of type Any, both operands shall be cast to string before the operator is applied and all items that fulfil the query MUST be included in the result.

**Example {counter:examples}: examples of $filter query option**

**Example Request 1:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Observations?$filter=result lt 10.00

returns all Observations whose result is less than 10.00.

In addition, clients can choose to use the properties of linked entities in the $filter predicate. The following are examples of the possible uses of the $filter in the data model of the SensorThings service.

**Example Request 2:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Observations?$filter=Datastream/id eq ‘1’

returns all Observations whose Datastream’s id is 1.

**Example Request 3:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Things?$filter=geo.distance(Locations/location, geography’POINT(-122, 43)’) gt 1

returns Things that the distance between their last known locations and POINT(-122 43) is greater than 1.

**Example Request 4:**

    http://example.org/v1.0/Things?$expand=Datastreams/Observations/FeatureOfInterest&$filter=Datastreams/Observations/FeatureOfInterest/id eq ‘FOI_1’ and Datastreams/Observations/resultTime ge 2010-06-01T00:00:00Z and Datastreams/Observations/resultTime le 2010-07-01T00:00:00Z

returns Things that have any observations of a feature of interest with a unique identifier equals to ’FOI_1’ in June 2010.

====== Built-in filter operations

The OGC SensorThings API supports a set of built-in filter operations, as described in the following table. These built-in filter operator usages and definitions follow the [http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata01/os/complete/part1-protocol/odata-v4.0-errata01-os-part1-protocol-complete.html#_Toc399426798[OData Specification Section 11.2.5.1.1]] and [http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/abnf/odata-abnf-construction-rules.txt[OData Version 4.0 ABNF]].

====== Built-in query functions

The OGC SensorThings API supports a set of functions that can be used with the $filter or $orderby query operations. The following table lists the available functions and they follows the OData Canonical function definitions listed in http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata01/os/complete/part2-url-conventions/odata-v4.0-errata01-os-part2-url-conventions-complete.html#_Toc395267133[Section 5.1.1.4] of the [OData Version 4.0 Part 2: URL Conventions] and the syntax rules for these functions are defined in [http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/errata02/os/complete/abnf/odata-abnf-construction-rules.txt[OData Version 4.0 ABNF]].

If a property with data type Any is used as a parameter of a built-in function the service MUST act as follows:

- If number or boolean is a valid data type for the parameter, call this version of the function, ignoring all records that do not have the type number/boolean,
- otherwise, if string is a valid data type for the parameter cast the value to string
- respond with 400 Bad Request.

If a build-in function is passed an argument of the wrong type, but the function accepts the type string, then cast the value to string.
If a build-in function is passed an argument of the wrong type, and the function does not accept the type string, then the service MUST respond with 400 Bad Request.


In order to support spatial relationship functions, SensorThings API defines nine additional geospatial functions based on the spatial relationship between two geometry objects. The spatial relationship functions are defined in the OGC Simple Feature Access specification [OGC 06-104r4 part 1, clause 6.1.2.3]. The names of these nine functions start with a prefix `+st_+` following the OGC Simple Feature Access specification [OGC 06-104r4]. In addition, the Well-Known Text (WKT) format is the default input geometry for these nine functions.

Req <<req-request-data-pagination>>: <<requirement-request-data-pagination>>

|Responses that include only a partial set of the items identified by the request URL SHALL contain a link that allows retrieving the next partial set of items. This link is called a nextLink;
its representation is format-specific. The final partial set of items SHALL NOT contain a nextLink.

The nextLink annotation indicates that a response is only a subset of the requested collection of entities or collection of entity references. It contains a URL that allows retrieving the next subset of the requested collection.

SensorThings clients SHALL treat the URL of the nextLink as opaque, and SHALL NOT append system query options to the URL of a next link. Services may not allow a change of format on requests for subsequent pages using the next link.
